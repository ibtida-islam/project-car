      Always Inspect Rental Car Before Driving Off is a crucial step to ensure a smooth and trouble-free rental experience. 
      Before leaving the rental lot, thoroughly inspect the car for any existing damage, such as scratches, dents, or tire wear. 
      Document any issues with photos or by noting them on the rental agreement. This helps prevent disputes later about damages you didn’t cause.
      
      Check the car's functionality, including lights, wipers, brakes, and air conditioning. 
      Lastly, confirm the fuel level and any specific instructions related to the vehicle’s operation. 
      Taking a few minutes for inspection can save time, money, and stress during your trip.

    "Accidents can happen anytime, even when driving a rental car. If you find yourself in this situation, it’s important to stay calm and follow the right steps to handle it properly. Atfirst, Ensure Safety First: Your safety and the safety of others involved is the top priority. If possible, move the vehicle to a safe area away from traffic. Turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers. Check for injuries, and if anyone is hurt, call emergency services immediately. Then, Contact the Authorities: Always report the accident to the local police, especially if there are significant damages or injuries. The police report is crucial for insurance purposes and legal protection. Ensure you get a copy of the report or the report number.Therefore, Document the Scene: Take detailed photos of the accident scene, including damages to the rental car and other vehicles involved. If there are any witnesses, ask for their contact information. This documentation can be vital when dealing with the rental agency and insurance companies. After that, Notify the Rental Company: Contact the rental agency as soon as possible to inform them about the accident. They will guide you on the next steps and may provide assistance, such as arranging for a replacement car or further instructions regarding insurance claims. Therefore, Review Insurance Coverage: Check your rental agreement to understand the insurance coverage you have. Most rental companies offer collision damage waivers (CDW) or supplemental insurance, which may cover the costs of damages. If you used your own insurance or a credit card for coverage, contact your provider to report the incident. Atlast, Follow Up on Claims: Once you’ve informed the rental agency and your insurance provider, follow up on the claims process. Be prepared to provide documentation and cooperate with any investigations.",

Here's how to do it smoothly: At first, Review Your Rental Agreement: Start by checking your rental agreement for terms on extensions. Some companies may allow extensions without extra charges, while others may impose fees.
